# Library-Management
A simple, desktop-based Library Management System built with Python and Tkinter for the GUI, using SQLite as the backend database. This application allows admins to manage books/movies, memberships, and users, while both admins and users can handle transactions (issuing/returning items, paying fines) and view various reports.
